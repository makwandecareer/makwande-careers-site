# Incident Response Plan

## Phases
1. **Identify**: Detect incident, log ticket, classify severity.
2. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems, rotate secrets, disable compromised accounts.
3. **Eradicate**: Remove malware, patch vulnerabilities.
4. **Recover**: Restore from backups, validate integrity, increase monitoring.
5. **Notify**: Under POPIA, notify Information Regulator and affected users **as soon as reasonably possible** after discovery of a compromise.
6. **Postmortem**: RCA within 5 working days; action items with owners and deadlines.
